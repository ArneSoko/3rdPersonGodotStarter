# 3rdPersonGodotStarter

**Description:**
Starter code and assets for a 3rd person game using Godot engine 

**Long Description:**
A friend and I have been planning some video game ideas for a while now. I decided to take the initiative to learn the Godot Engine a little bit. 
We chose Godot because it's relatively lightweight, compared to something like Unity or Unreal Engine which I can't open on my laptop at all. 
After a week of work, I put together a basic starting point for any 3rd Person 3D game using Godot engine.

**Features**
-Basic movement (jumping is set as an input event, but not added as a function)
-Basic physics (collision, falling)
-Camera with adjustable zoom
-Pause menu with option to close the menu or quit the game

I hope anyone who finds this starter setup useful goes on to do great things!
